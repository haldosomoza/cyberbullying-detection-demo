Problem Statement:

Social media platforms are dealing with a growing problem of cyber-bullying, which harms users, reduces their activity on the platforms, and hurts the platforms' reputations. The problem we are addressing is to develop a machine learning system that accurately identifies instances of cyber-bullying in real-time across multiple social media platforms. 

A key metric to address this problem is parental awareness. According to Statistics Canada , about 22% of youth whose parents are always or often aware of their online activity report being cyberbullied, compared to 29% of those whose parents are sometimes or never aware. By getting parents more involved and aware of their children's online activities, we can further decrease the occurrences of cyber-bullying.

To start our target stakeholders, include schools, government agencies overseeing school boards, and any institutions that have online chat functionalities. These organizations are crucial in fostering safe online environments for young users and can benefit significantly from implementing our machine learning system.

To conclude, cyber-bullying undermines user well-being and damages the platform's reputation and user engagement. By utilizing data analytics and machine learning algorithms, social media platforms, schools, and other institutions can detect and manage toxic behavior in real-time, promoting healthier interactions and keeping users engaged.
